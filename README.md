`bang.el` has been renamed to `dash.el`

## Oh dear, why?

Renaming a project is such a hassle. There has to be some good reason.

### The bang signifies a destructive operation

In ruby, methods often have two forms - with or without the `!`. The
method with a bang is then destructive. The functions in dash on the
other hand are all non-destructive, pure functions.

### The ! prefix made for jarring visuals

Looking at code with bangs everywhere was noisy. So while bang was a
fitting name in that regard, the dash looks a lot better.

### The new name is quite dashing.

Ahem, sorry. But while `bang` brings up images of explosions and brute
force, `dash` is speedy and elegant. Not too shabby of a name I'd say.
